Software Requirements Specificationfor Bounce Mission Control (NASA API Explorer)Version: 1.2Date: 18 June 2025Author: GeminiProject Name: Bounce Mission Control1. Introduction1.1 PurposeThis document provides a detailed specification of the requirements for the "Bounce Mission Control" web application. Its purpose is to serve as a foundational guide for developers, designers, and testers, ensuring that the final product aligns with the objectives outlined in the "bounce Insights" coding challenge. It defines the system's features, constraints, and success criteria.1.2 Project ScopeThe project entails the development of a full-stack web application that allows users to explore space-related data provided by NASA's Open APIs. The application will consist of a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend, deployed to a live environment. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on two core features: the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) Viewer and the Mars Rover Photo Explorer.1.3 Intended AudienceThis SRS is intended for:Software Developers: To understand the technical requirements, architecture, and features to be implemented.Project Evaluators: To assess the completed project against the specified requirements and evaluation criteria.1.4 Definitions, Acronyms, and AbbreviationsTermDefinitionAPODAstronomy Picture of the DayAPIApplication Programming InterfaceMVPMinimum Viable ProductNASANational Aeronautics and Space AdministrationSRSSoftware Requirements SpecificationUIUser InterfaceUXUser ExperienceSolA Martian day, as measured by NASA for rover missions.CI/CDContinuous Integration / Continuous Deployment2. Overall Description2.1 Product PerspectiveBounce Mission Control is a self-contained web application that acts as a client to NASA's public data services. It will feature a decoupled architecture where the React frontend communicates with a dedicated Node.js backend. The backend serves as a secure proxy and intermediary to the external NASA APIs, abstracting the data-fetching logic and securing the API key.2.2 User CharacteristicsThe target user is a member of the general public with an interest in astronomy and space exploration, as well as the technical evaluation team from "bounce Insights". Users are expected to have a basic understanding of web navigation.2.3 ConstraintsC-1: Technology Stack: The frontend must be built with React. The backend must be built with Node.js and Express.C-2: Deadline: The project must be completed and submitted within two weeks of receipt of the challenge.C-3: Deployment: The application must be deployed to a live, publicly accessible URL.C-4: API Source: The application must exclusively use the NASA Open APIs (api.nasa.gov) as its data source.3. System Features (Functional Requirements)3.1 SF-1: APOD ViewerDescription: This feature allows users to view the Astronomy Picture of the Day.Requirements:3.1.1 Default Display: The system shall display today's picture or video by default, along with its title and full explanation.3.1.2 Date Selection (Bonus): The system shall provide a date picker for the user to select a past date and view the corresponding APOD.3.1.3 Media Handling: The system shall correctly render content whether the API returns an image or an embedded video.User Stories:As a user, when I visit the APOD page, I want to see today's picture or video displayed by default, along with its title and full explanation.As a user, I want to use a date picker to select any past date and view the corresponding APOD for that day.As a user, I expect the application to correctly render the content, whether it's an image or an embedded video from a source like YouTube.3.2 SF-2: Mars Rover Photo ExplorerDescription: This feature allows users to explore photos from the Mars Curiosity rover.Requirements:3.2.1 Default Display: The system shall display the most recent photos taken by the Curiosity rover by default.3.2.2 Search by Sol (Bonus): The system shall provide a search field for the user to enter a Martian Day number ("sol") and view all photos from that day.3.2.3 Gallery Layout: The system shall display rover photos in a clean, responsive grid layout.3.2.4 Modal View: The system shall allow a user to click any photo thumbnail to view a larger, high-resolution version in a modal overlay.User Stories:As a user, when I visit the Mars Rover page, I want to see the most recent photos taken by the Curiosity rover by default.As a user, I want to enter a Martian Day number (a "sol") into a search field to view all photos taken by the Curiosity rover on that specific day.As a user, I want to see the rover photos displayed in a clean, responsive grid layout.As a user, I want to be able to click on any photo thumbnail in the gallery to view a larger, high-resolution version in a modal overlay.3.3 SF-3: Backend APIDescription: The backend server handles data fetching from the NASA API.Requirements:3.3.1 APOD Endpoint: The backend shall expose GET /api/apod. It will accept an optional date query parameter. If no date is provided, it will default to the current day.3.3.2 Mars Rover Photos Endpoint: The backend shall expose GET /api/mars-photos. It will accept a sol query parameter to fetch photos for a specific Martian day.4. Non-Functional Requirements4.1 NFR-1: Performance & Reliability4.1.1 Loading State Management: The UI must clearly indicate when data is being fetched (e.g., via a loading spinner or skeleton screen). This is a mandatory requirement.4.1.2 Error Handling: The UI must display a user-friendly error message if a backend API call fails or if the backend cannot retrieve data from NASA. This is a mandatory requirement.4.2 NFR-2: Security4.2.1 API Key Security: The NASA API key must be stored as a secure environment variable on the backend and must never be exposed to the frontend client. This is a mandatory requirement.4.3 NFR-3: Usability (Bonus)4.3.1 Responsive Design: The application must be fully usable and aesthetically pleasing on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.4.4 NFR-4: Deployment & DevOps4.4.1 Live Application: The application must be deployed to live, publicly accessible URLs (one for frontend, one for backend).4.4.2 Containerization (Bonus): The backend Node.js application should be containerized using a Dockerfile to demonstrate modern deployment practices.4.4.3 CI/CD (Bonus): A CI pipeline using GitHub Actions should be implemented to automate linting and testing for both frontend and backend repositories.4.5 NFR-5: Maintainability4.5.1 Code Structure: The repository shall be organized with separate frontend/ and backend/ directories. Code must be well-structured, readable, and follow best practices.4.5.2 Documentation: A comprehensive README.md must be included, detailing the project, setup instructions, and how to run the application locally.4.6 NFR-6: Testing (Bonus)4.6.1 Backend Tests: API endpoints should have unit tests written with Jest.4.6.2 Frontend Tests: Key React components should have unit/integration tests written with Jest and React Testing Library.
